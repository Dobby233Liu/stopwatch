Import swm, sw_cfg and swi to your project.

Edit sw_cfg however you please.

Then, in the Create events of the objects you want to use the system in,
put in:

    swi()

To set a timer, do:

    stopwatch[i] = n

When the timer ticks to 0, the Alarm i event is called.

You may also want to use swm.delta_factor in your objects. It is a multiplier
to (kinda) turn frame-based timers time-based.
For example:

    x += 1
    // -->
    x += 1 * swm.delta_factor
